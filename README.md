This is a class made by me for practice, to see what I know and what I can do.
Everything works as as it should and it is tested.

NOTICE: If anyone is actualy reading this/using the class ,I am still a junior programmer, so if there are any big mistakes feel free to point them out, I am eager to hear it.
The class was made for easier access to the database, and faster work.


The Model class is suposed to be used with another, as seen in the test.php file. 
Guidelines
- The tableName() and attributes() function have to be set.
- The attributes array has to be made so it is in the same order as the data in the table, with the primary key being the first value in the array.

SELECT:

Cases and usage explained from line 17 to line 46 in the test.php file

INSERT:

Cases and usage explained from line 49 to line 67 in the test.php file

UPDATE:

Cases and usage explained from line 70 to line 92 in the test.php file

DELETE:

Cases and usage explained from line 95 to line 116 in the test.php file
